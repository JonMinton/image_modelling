The aim of this project is to take some famous images and only 'represent' them through 'age', 'period' and 'cohort' effects.

The specific tasks are: 

* Find way to download some famous images
* Load the images as matrices
* Model the matrices as
    * Age alone
    * Period alone
    * Cohort alone
    * Age:Period
    * Age:Cohort
    * Age^{2}
    * Period^{2}
    * Cohort^{2}
    * etc

# Find images to download 



```{r load_prereq}
require(tidyverse)
require(magick)
```


```{r load_images, eval = F}
download.file(
  "http://dujye7n3e5wjl.cloudfront.net/photographs/1080-tall/time-100-influential-photos-lunch-atop-skyscraper-19.jpg",
  "images/image_01.jpg",
  mode = "wb"
)

```

Other possible images are [here](http://100photos.time.com/)


Now to try to load this as a matrix 

```{r read_images}
image <- magick::image_read("images/image_01.jpg") %>% 
  image_convert(type = "grayscale") # convert to grayscale

```

Rescale to 250 pixels wide


```{r image_rescale}
image_rescaled <- image_scale(image, "250")

```


EBImage looks like it's closer to R in that it uses class `Image` which extends `base::array`. 


```{r read_image}
ebimage <- EBImage::readImage("images/image_01.jpg")

```


```{r convert_to_grey}
image_matrix <- apply(EBImage::imageData(ebimage_grey), c(1, 2), mean)

```

Convert matrix to dataframe

```{r convert_to_df}


```
